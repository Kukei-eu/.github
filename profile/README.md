# Welcome to Kukei

This is a GitHub organisation behind [kukei.eu](https://kukei.eu), a curated search for web developers.

Most if not all of the code behind it is open source. You can find here:

- [Main website code](./kukei-web) - server side rendering powered by CloudFlare Pages
- [Spider / crawler](./spider) - crawler code (runs on Hetzner machine as a cron job)

Feel free to use the website, contribute or provide me some feedback on my [Mastodon](https://social.nowicki.io/home)
